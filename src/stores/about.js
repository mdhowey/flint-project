    text: "Originally from Perham, Minnesota, Howey grew up in a small town made famous by potato chips and dog food. Here he devloped a love for music and spent most of his young life bothering the neighbors with his drums. He studied jazz for a time in university and worked every concievable job in restaurants to put some money in his pocket while studying music. From dishwasher to cook, server to bartender, and beverage director to assitant general manager, he had had enough of restaurants. Always having a love for language, he has spent the last 5 years in Mexico City working as both an English teacher and content writer while studying Spanish.",
